                <h3>RAVEDM 4x4x4</h3>
                <p>RAVEDM or Rgb Audio Visualizing Electro Dancable Music 4x4x4 (I tried my best to fit it into the title)
                   It is a 4x4x4 Green LED cube as of now. I couldn't make RGB possible as of now due to the high price of data transfer LEDS,
                   and my inability to control 28 (8 for each color and 4 for ground) pins with PWM. Even MEGA has 12 PWMs as far as I can remember
                   (fact check this), I would require 2 Megas and one UNO atleast or some other solution. I explained this project in the github page below.

      <h3>How to Train Your Dinosaur</h3>
      <p>
        This project involves the re-creation of the classic Chrome Dinosaur game using
        python and making AI play the game. We have used Supervised Learning as well as
        Genetic Learning in parts to train the model.<br><br>
        We first built a standalone game on python using the help of pygame so that we
        could visually and manually play the game in order to collect training data.<br><br>
        We then concatenated all the csv file(training data) into one file and fed this
        to the train_simple_model.py, which is a very basic CNN model that
        trains over the given data and saves the best model in a .pth file (say,
        best_model.pth). <br><br>
         This concludes the Supervised Learning part.
        We them passed this best_model.pth file to the RL model,
        Genetic_Model.py that uses Genetic algorithms such as - mutation, population
