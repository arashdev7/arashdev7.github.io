    <h1>My Gaming 3X3</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      Given the theme of this website, it seemed fitting to base my first blog post on games - video games in more particular. We had a PS2 in the household in my early years and then I had a PS4 later on. Video Games, according to me, is one of the most interactive and immersive experience you can get of a universe, a story or a character. So when I was thinking about what I should write about video-games, a 3 by 3 crossed my mind, why? thanks to all the time I spent listening to Trash Taste podcast. So here is my gaming 3X3:

      <h2>Persona 5</h2>
      <p>
      I was always fascinated by why Persona 5 was so highly rated as a game, it had almost perfect scores across all platforms, but when I saw the gameplay, it didn't have the best graphics, it was a turn based game, so it wasn't like a fighter game where you are on the edge of the seat playing it, and even when I played it, the story was pretty meh, a lot of the it was text based and grindy, So why, just why is it such a great game?<br></br> VIBES - It is one of the most stylistic game of all time. Straight from the start menu, you can feel, it's just different. From one of the best menu UI/UX design, to the stylistic rendition of Japan, to the social sim resulting in battle advantages, to all the mini side games, it is a unique experience, that made me appreciate design and artistic creativity in a time when AI slop has been taking over our lives. I would have never put 115 hours of my life into any other game. Also one of the best OSTs in a game I have seen. I have played the bank level background track while studying so many times I have lost count. </p>

      <h2>FIFA/PES</h2>
    <p>  
      Fifa has just been a constant in my life, from playing Fifa 08 with my brother on my mother's pc in her university, to playing PES 12-14 on the ps2, deleting my brother's career mode by mistake, to buying fifa 18 for the ps4, the Alex Hunter story,to Fifa 21 and now Fifa 25 with the boys in my hostel. Institute Fifa Champion aese hi thoda bnte hain ¬‿¬    </p>
    <h2>Last of Us</h2>
    <p>Last of Us was just pure Cinema, I have never been immersed in a world and cared about the 2 main characters as much as I have done in this. It was just 20 hours,but the details in this were soooo great. The fact that I got into it spoiler free somehow was also cherry on the top, I did not know what would happen. The Last of 2 on the other hand was memed so much both for the game and the series that I managed to get some spoilers for it(I will become a daad (-_-*)), but for the 30 or so minutes I have played it, it seems to be up there as well. It will not capture my heart as much though cause the Joel-Ellie relationship in Part 1 was special.</p>
    <h2>Stanley Parable</h2>
    <p>I have never played this game, but boy have I watched every possible ending for this an unfilthy amount of times. Meta would be an understatement for this game. You will just have to play this game to understand what I mean.The narrator is theee GOAT</p>
    <h2>Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3</h2>
    <p>The 3-d fighter of my childhood and the game through which I experienced dragon ball even before watching it, this is still better than most 3-d fighers available today. I had tons of fun while playing this with my cousins and my brother. I want to buy Sparking Zero so badly to experience this game to its full capabilities. </p>
    <h2>Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam</h2>
    <p>Another one of the ps2 classics, though this would not be the tony hawk game most people would recommend you to play. The story of how I discovered this game is very funny. As a child of course, I didn't know who in the hell Tony Hawk was and I was like ehhhh I don't like this game. The store owner kept recommending it and said to my face that as a kid I would of course not like the game from its cover as it was not shiny and all and told me to take the game and return it if I wouldn't like it "bhai bache to aese hi hote nakhren maarte ek baar lejaake to dekho" was the words he said to my bhaiya to which he agreed. I was sad and cried because we didn't buy some spiderman game I think. But boy was he right. one of the most fun and absurd racing game I have seen. The number of shortcuts and the difficulty to get them makes this game so fun. The music also - top notch </p>  
    <h2>Spiderman</h2>
    <p>This was a dream of a game. I don't think you can beat the opening sequence of this game - pure cinema. Straight from the apartment into the action with Alive playing in the background. I genuinely boot into the game sometimes just to swing around the city - just an experience you can't beat. I think till date the only game I have 100 percent completed. Also the best peter parker of any peter parker, the only format in which MJ was likable. They just straight up changed the face models for the second game how am I supposed to take it seriously, I was attached to the earlier face models. </p>
    <h2>Mouthwashing</h2>
    <p>The weirdest name you can imagine for a game. I did not know how cinematic this indie horror game would be when I watched(don't judge me I'll play it also someday after buying it properly) it on youtube. I have watched a LOT of indie horror games while having breakfast in my JEE days. I don't know when this became a hobby of mine, but I have watched amost all of jackcepticeye's horror game videos in that time. This  and Love, Sam are 2 of my favourites. Chilla's Art and Puppet combo also has some great titles.</p>
    <h2>Little Fighter 2</h2>
    I wanted to include a title from my early chidhood days when I didn't have a ps2, the days of playing fifa8, cricket8, Purble Place etc. I used to play a game called Champions 3D in Adobe flash player as well. Little Figher 2 was something my and my cousins played on the same keyboard together in my holidays and it was hella fun. looking back at it makes me realize, how dead the gaming industry is now with the lack of couch co-ops. The only game I can think of is 'it takes two'. It seems like an untapped market. Might wanna do a start-up in this sector lmao
    <h2>Honourable Mentions</h2>
    I just wanna name some other games I had a great time playing and would love to play again:<br>
    1. Smackdown Here Comes the Pain : Another couch co-op classic with my friends, though I guess 2k is also making good games nowadays.<br>
    2. Neva : A beautiful indie game I enjoyed during the ending of my third semester. Me and my friend chinmay randomly found this game and fell in love with it<br>
    3. Cuphead : Another game I play with my friends sometimes. The artstle with the unique bosses make it special.<br>
    4. Horizon Zero Dawn : My memory of this game has been ruined by the bad story and queerbaiting in the second game. Still stands as the most beautiful games I have ever played.Second game had great moments but the story lets it down a lot.<br>
    5. Uncharted 4: It would have been in there if I hadn't played last of us. Great game, the cinematic levels are some of the best levels out there, buuuuut I think I would have loved it more if I would have played the first 3 games. Also No nah Nadda is something I say to myself weirdly, Thanks for that i guess lmao <br>
    6. Arkham Knight: I 50 percented the game and went to college and haven't touched it since, that is my bad, will finish it afterwards. I think it has the best ever open world in a game ever though. <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
      I am currently playing Outer Wilds, I am loving it so far, also have to finish games like last of us 2, and Arkham Knight. I also have other indie game son my list that I wanna try so maybe I'll update this list in the future. SUIIIIIIIIII
